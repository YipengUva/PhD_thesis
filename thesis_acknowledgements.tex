The four years PhD life in Amsterdam is hard but fruitful. Before I came here, I didn't have much confidence on myself for the transition from a experimental biomedical student to a data analyst (or statistician). However, in Amsterdam, I really learned a lot on data analysis and statistics, and have some achievements for my PhD research on the methodological development for heterogeneous data fusion. During this process, I got a lot of help and support. Therefore I would like to express my gratitude here.

First and foremost I want to thank Age Smilde and Johan Westerhuis for your supervision and guiding through my PhD life. I appreciate all the discussions we have and your insightful comments during my PhD life, which helped me a lot to have a better understanding of research, matrix algebra and statistics. Also thanks for accepting me to do my PhD research here in BDA group. This is an opportunity for me to prove my ability in learning statistics and doing statical research.

I also want to thank Huub Hoefsloot for you teaching of matrix algebra course together with Age Smilde. A strong basis on matrix algebra helps a lot in understanding statistical algorithms and doing methodological development research. Also would like to acknowledge Gooitzen Zwanenburg for your help in solving my problems with respect to computer, software, Internet and many other things. In addition, I want to thank Dicle, Sandra and Chloie. I am glade to be in the same office with you and for the discussion we have about life, research and many other things. Thanks for all the members in BDA group for the interesting coffee break conversations, the presentations and discussions during the group meetings.

Part of my PhD research is collaborated with Lodewyk Wessels, Nanne Aben from the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI) and Patrick J.F. Groenen from Erasmus University. Thanks to Lodewyk Wessels and Nanne Aben for the real data sets you provided, your insightful comments on our paper and all the biological interpretations of the results. Thanks to Patrick for your insightful comments on the algorithm part of GSCA model.

Lastly, I would like to thank my family and my girl friend for your love and encouragement.
